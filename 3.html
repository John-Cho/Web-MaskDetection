                    The pandemic is known by several names. It is often referred in news media as the "coronavirus pandemic",
                    [9] despite the existence of other human coronaviruses that have caused epidemics and outbreaks (e.g. SARS).[10]
                    During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus", "Wuhan coronavirus",
                    [11] "the coronavirus outbreak" and the "Wuhan coronavirus outbreak"[12] with the disease sometimes called "Wuhan pneumonia".
                    [13][14] In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCoV[15] and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease[16] as interim names for the virus and 
                    disease per 2015 international guidelines against using geographical locations (e.g. Wuhan, China), animal species, or groups of people in disease and 
                    virus names in part to prevent social stigma.[17] WHO finalized the official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020.[18] Tedros Adhanom explained: 
                    CO for corona, VI for virus, D for disease and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified (31 December 2019).[19] WHO additionally uses "the COVID-19 virus" 
                    and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.[18]
